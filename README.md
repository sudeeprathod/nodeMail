Nodemailer
Nodemailer

Nodemailer is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending. The project got started back in 2010 when there was no sane option to send email messages, today it is the solution most Node.js users turn to by default.

Nodemailer is licensed under MIT license. See license details in the License page. If you are upgrading from Nodemailer v2 or older, then see the light migration guide here.

npm install nodemailer --save

Requirements

    Node.js v6+. Thatâ€™s it.

If you are able to run Node.js version 6 or newer, then you can use Nodemailer. There are no platform or resource specific requirements.
TL;DR

In short, what you need to do to send messages, would be the following:

    Create a Nodemailer transporter using either SMTP or some other transport mechanism
    Set up message options (who sends what to whom)
    Deliver the message object using the sendMail() method of your previously created transporter

Not Able to send Mail using transport ?

If createTransport function is not taking up the path which is â€˜/usr/bin/sendMailâ€™, make sure you have sendmail configured in your system. Take a look at Source (for linux/unix).
Example

This is a complete example to send an email with plain text and HTML body

'use strict';
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Generate test SMTP service account from ethereal.email
// Only needed if you don't have a real mail account for testing
nodemailer.createTestAccount((err, account) => {
    // create reusable transporter object using the default SMTP transport
    let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
        host: 'smtp.ethereal.email',
        port: 587,
        secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
        auth: {
            user: account.user, // generated ethereal user
            pass: account.pass // generated ethereal password
        }
    });

    // setup email data with unicode symbols
    let mailOptions = {
        from: '"Fred Foo ðŸ‘»" <foo@example.com>', // sender address
        to: 'bar@example.com, baz@example.com', // list of receivers
        subject: 'Hello âœ”', // Subject line
        text: 'Hello world?', // plain text body
        html: '<b>Hello world?</b>' // html body
    };

    // send mail with defined transport object
    transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
        if (error) {
            return console.log(error);
        }
        console.log('Message sent: %s', info.messageId);
        // Preview only available when sending through an Ethereal account
        console.log('Preview URL: %s', nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info));

        // Message sent: <b658f8ca-6296-ccf4-8306-87d57a0b4321@example.com>
        // Preview URL: https://ethereal.email/message/WaQKMgKddxQDoou...
    });
});
